# EmberCLI Rails - Assets

The `ember-cli-rails-assets` gem extends [`ember-cli-rails`][ember-cli-rails] to
enable rendering EmberCLI-generated JavaScript and CSS stylesheets into your
Rails application's layout HTML.

**This project and the behavior it supports is deprecated.**

Rendering EmberCLI applications with `render_ember_app` is the recommended,
actively supported method of serving EmberCLI applications.

However, for the sake of backwards compatibility, `ember-cli-rails-assets`
supports injecting the EmberCLI-generated assets into an existing Rails layout.

## Install

Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "ember-cli-rails-assets"
```

Then run `bundle install`:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Setup

To configure your project to use `ember-cli-rails`, follow the instructions
listed in the [`ember-cli-rails` README][README].

To configure your project to user `ember-cli-rails-assets`, ensure each Ember
application's `ember-cli-build.js` includes the following values:

```js
// frontend/ember-cli-build.js

module.exports = function(defaults) {
  var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    // http://ember-cli.com/user-guide/#application-configuration
    storeConfigInMeta: false,

    fingerprint: {
      // https://github.com/rickharrison/broccoli-asset-rev#options
      generateAssetMap: true,
    },
  });
};
```

## Mount

Mount the Ember application (in this example, the `frontend` application) to the
desired path:

```rb
# config/routes.rb

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount_ember_app :frontend, to: "/", controller: "ember#index"
end
```

Then, in the corresponding view, use the asset helpers:

```erb
<!-- app/views/ember/index.html.erb -->

<%= include_ember_script_tags :frontend %>
<%= include_ember_stylesheet_tags :frontend %>
```

## Caveats

### Mounting

If you're using the `include_ember` style helpers with a single-page Ember
application that defers routing to the Rails application, insert a call to
`mount_ember_assets` at the bottom of your routes file to serve the
EmberCLI-generated assets:

```rb
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount_ember_assets :frontend, to: "/"
end
```

### Rendering

When injecting the EmberCLI-generated assets with the `include_ember_script_tags`
and `include_ember_stylesheet_tags` helpers to a path other than `"/"`, a
`<base>` tag must also be injected with a corresponding `href` value:

```erb
<base href="/">
<%= include_ember_script_tags :frontend %>
<%= include_ember_stylesheet_tags :frontend %>

<base href="/admin_panel/">
<%= include_ember_script_tags :admin_panel %>
<%= include_ember_stylesheet_tags :admin_panel %>
```

#### Rendering without `<base>` element

To render the asset elements without using a `<base>` element, pass the URL or
path to prepend:

```erb
<-- assuming Ember's assets are mounted to `"/"` -->
<%= include_ember_script_tags :frontend, prepend: "/" %>
<%= include_ember_stylesheet_tags :frontend, prepend: "/" %>

<%= include_ember_script_tags :admin_panel, prepend: "/admin_panel/" %>
<%= include_ember_stylesheet_tags :admin_panel, prepend: "/admin_panel/" %>
```
